I am currently working as a **Software Engineer at [upGrad](https://www.upgrad.com/)**. I enjoy learning new Tech and often breaks things a lot 😅
I strongly believe that you will learn the most when you are trying to fix things 😁.

Apart from this I also enjoy writing articles. You can find some of my writings on my [dev.to profile](https://dev.to/jasmin).
